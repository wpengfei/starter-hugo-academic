  Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) is an effective
approach designed to strengthen testing vulnerable code areas
via predefined target sites. The state-of-the-art DGF techniques
redefine and optimize the fitness metric to reach the target sites
precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for fitness metrics
are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that
have not been exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths
with complex constraints would hinder DGF from reaching the
targets, making DGF less efficient.
In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed greybox
fuzzer that can combine historical and predicted information
to steer DGF to reach the target site via an optimal path. We
first propose the path transition model, which models DGF as a
process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause
the path transition, and the path corresponding to the highreward
path transition sequence indicates a high likelihood of
reaching the target site through it. Then, to predict the path
transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE),
which gradually imitates the path transition model and predicts
the rewards of path transitions that have not been taken yet.
To determine the optimal path, we develop a Reinforcement
Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can
combine historical and predicted path transitions to generate the
optimal path transition sequences, along with the policy to guide
the mutation strategy of fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the highreward
path transition sequence, we propose the concept of an
action group, which comprehensively optimizes the critical steps of
fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target efficiently.
We evaluated DeepGo on 2 benchmark suites consisting of 25
programs with a total of 100 target sites. The experimental
results show that DeepGo achieves 3.23×, 1.72×, 1.81×, and
4.83× speedup compared to AFLGo, BEACON,WindRanger, and
ParmeSan, respectively in reaching target sites, and 2.61×, 3.32×,
2.43× and 2.53× speedup in exposing known vulnerabilities.
