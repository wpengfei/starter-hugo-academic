abstract: The hierarchy theory is the foundation of the modern computer system
  design. However, the interaction part between different system layers is
  usually the weak point of the system, which tends to have security flaws. When
  communicating across the system boundary, failure to enforce the required
  synchronization in the shared memory can cause data inconsistency of the
  communication partners. Especially when there is a privilege gap between
  different boundary sides, such data inconsistency can lead to security
  vulnerability and sabotage the trust boundary. In this paper, we propose the
  concept of inter-boundary vulnerability and give the first in-depth study of
  them. We investigate three typical boundaries in the system that
  inter-boundary vulnerabilities are prone to occur, including the kernel-user
  boundary, the hardware-OS boundary, and the VMM-guest OS boundary. Then, based
  on the investigation of 115 real-world vulnerability cases, we extract four
  vulnerability types and provide analysis for each type to illustrate the
  principle. Finally, we discuss the state-of-the-art techniques that are
  relevant to the detection, prevention, and exploitation of such
  vulnerabilities, aiming to light the future research on this topic.
