summary: |-
  Vulnerability fixing is time-consuming, hence, not all
  of the discovered vulnerabilities can be fixed timely. In reality,
  developers prioritize vulnerability fixing based on exploitability.
  Large numbers of vulnerabilities are delayed to patch or even
  ignored as they are regarded as “unexploitable” or underestimated
  owing to the difficulty in exploiting the weak primitives.
  However, exploits may have been in the wild. In this paper,
  to exploit the weak primitives that traditional approaches fail
  to exploit, we propose a versatile exploitation strategy that can
  transform weak exploit primitives into strong exploit primitives.
  Based on a special object in the kernel named Thanos object,
  our approach can exploit a UAF vulnerability that does not have
  function pointer dereference and an OOB write vulnerability that
  has limited write length and value. Our approach overcomes the
  shortage that traditional exploitation strategies heavily rely on the
  capability of the vulnerability. To facilitate using Thanos objects,
  we devise a tool named TAODE to automatically search for eligible
  Thanos objects from the kernel. Then, it evaluates the usability of
  the identified Thanos objects by the complexity of the constraints.
  Finally, it pairs vulnerabilities with eligible Thanos objects. We
  have evaluated our approach with real-world kernels. TAODE
  successfully identified numerous Thanos objects from Linux.
  Using the identified Thanos objects, we proved the feasibility of
  our approach with 20 real-world vulnerabilities, most of which
  traditional techniques failed to exploit. Through the experiments,
  we find that in addition to exploiting weak primitives, our
  approach can sometimes bypass the kernel SMAP mechanism
  (CVE-2016-10150, CVE-2016-0728), better utilize the leaked heap
  pointer address (CVE-2022-25636), and even theoretically break
  certain vulnerability patches (e.g., double-free).
