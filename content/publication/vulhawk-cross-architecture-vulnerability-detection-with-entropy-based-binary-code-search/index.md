  Code reuse is widespread in software development.
It brings a heavy spread of vulnerabilities, threatening software
security. Unfortunately, with the development and deployment
of the Internet of Things (IoT), the harms of code reuse are
magnified. Binary code search is a viable way to find these
hidden vulnerabilities. Facing IoT firmware images compiled
by different compilers with different optimization levels from
different architectures, the existing methods are hard to fit these
complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel intermediate
representation function model, which is an architecture-agnostic
model for cross-architecture binary code search. It lifts binary
code into microcode and preserves the main semantics of binary
functions via complementing implicit operands and pruning
redundant instructions. Then, we use natural language processing
techniques and graph convolutional networks to generate function
embeddings. We call the combination of a compiler, architecture,
and optimization level as a file environment, and take a divideand-
conquer strategy to divide a similarity calculation problem
of C2N cross-file-environment scenarios into N ô€€€ 1 embedding
transferring sub-problems. We propose an entropy-based adapter
to transfer function embeddings from different file environments
into the same file environment to alleviate the differences caused
by various file environments. To precisely identify vulnerable
functions, we propose a progressive search strategy to supplement
function embeddings with fine-grained features to reduce false
positives caused by patched functions. We implement a prototype
named VulHawk and conduct experiments under seven different
tasks to evaluate its performance and robustness. The experiments
show VulHawk outperforms Asm2Vec, Asteria, BinDiff, GMN,
PalmTree, SAFE, and Trex.
